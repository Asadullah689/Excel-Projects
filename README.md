Dominant parties over the course of U.S. history (e.g., Democratic and Republican).
Emerging or extinct parties, such as Federalist, Whig, or Democratic-Republican.
The proportion of nonpartisan or independent presidents, highlighting political diversity in early U.S. history.
This analysis supports historical political research and trends in presidential elections.</p2>
